# Todo App with Atlas UI

![CI Status](https://github.com/dil-asomlai/ai-assisted-coding-training/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

A React-based Todo application built with TypeScript, Material UI, and Atlas UI components. This project demonstrates modern React development practices with proper state management, component architecture, and comprehensive testing.

## Features

- ✅ Create, read, update, and delete todo items
- ✅ Mark todos as completed
- ✅ Session persistence (survives page refreshes)
- ✅ Responsive design with Material UI
- ✅ TypeScript for type safety
- ✅ React Context for state management
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Prettier and ESLint for code quality
- ✅ Husky pre-commit hooks
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow

## Project Structure

The project follows a feature-based organization:

```

├── __tests__/                   # Test files
├── assets/                      # Media assets
├── components/                  # React components

├── providers/                   # React providers
├── types/                       # TypeScript type definitions
├── utils/                       # Utility functions
└── ...
```

## Session Persistence

Todo items are automatically saved to the browser's `sessionStorage` to persist across page refreshes within the same browser session.

**Scope:**

- ✅ Survives page refreshes during the same browser session
- ✅ Automatically clears when the browser is closed
- ✅ Graceful handling of corrupted data
- ✅ Storage quota error handling with user feedback

**Limitations:**

- ❌ No encryption of stored data
- ❌ No cross-device synchronization
- ❌ Data is cleared when browser session ends
